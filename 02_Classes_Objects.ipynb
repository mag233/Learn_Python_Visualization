    "~~Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent data and functionality. In Python, you can define classes to create objects that encapsulate data and behavior.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "An object,in Python as… well, a thing. (I know, deep, right?)\n",
    "\n",
    "But seriously:\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is like a little self-contained “mini-universe” in your code. It’s not just data—it’s data and stuff you can do with that data, bundled up together. If you’re coming from a non-coding world, imagine an object like a coffee cup. It has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Properties (“attributes”): color, size, whether it has an embarrassing motivational quote on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actions (“methods”): fill(), empty(), smash dramatically against the wall on Monday morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings? Objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists? Objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically: An object is `an instance `of `a class.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wait! What is an instance and a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Class`: The Blueprint, the Legend, the Prophecy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as the blueprint for a character in your favorite RPG. It’s the recipe, the character sheet, the legendary template.The class in Python is the Platonic Ideal—the perfect, abstract “Form” of something, living high above in Code Olympus. Plato (the ancient Greek philosopher, not your new indie game character) believed that for every object in the real world, there’s a perfect, invisible “Idea” or “Form” of it. For example, there’s an ideal “Chair”—not any one chair, but the pure concept of “Chair-ness.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- The class says: “All Warriors have a sword, a shield, and the ability to swing that sword.”\n",
    "  \n",

    "        self.name = name\n",

    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Instance`: The Hero Who Actually Enters the Dungeon, the hero with a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance is when you take that class and make a real, living (well, until the boss fight) character. When you create a Warrior called “Thorin Oakenshield,” that’s an instance. He’s a unique hero with his own stats and a tendency to die heroically. An instance of a class is \"the object created from the class blueprint.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here’s how you create instances of the Warrior class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "thorin = Warrior(\"Thorin Oakenshield\", hp = 9999, strength = 100)\n",
    "frodo = Warrior(\"Frodo the Tiny\", hp = 50, strength = 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some things in the Warrior Class we haven't covered yet, which are the \"attack\" and \"defend\" functions. However, when we talk about a function related to an object, it becomes a method. Don't ask me why. It just does, like many other things makes no sense in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Methods`: The Warrior’s Moves\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is like a skill or action your hero can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In RPGs: “Attack,” “Defend,” “Use Potion,” “Taunt the Dragon”—these are all skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python: a method is a function inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s something every Warrior knows how to do, just by virtue of being a Warrior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: Can a Hero Learn Unique Skills?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely! Your hero can totally get special moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shared Skills: Methods defined in the class are shared—every Warrior gets them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique (Instance-Specific) Skills: You can add a special method (skill) to just one hero. It’s a little “hacky,” but Python lets you do it. You can do this by defining a function outside the class and then binding it to the specific instance.\n",
