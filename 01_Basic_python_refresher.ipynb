    "A typical structure of error handling in Python looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Handling specific exception\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handling generic exception\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to run if no exceptions were raised\n",
    "    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that always runs\n",
    "    print(\"Cleanup actions can be performed here.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling is another confusing yet important concept for beginners like me. The try block is where you put the code that might cause an error, and the except block is where you handle the error if it occurs. The errors are either predefined exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError` or custom exceptions that you can define yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to handle a file not found error, you can use `FileNotFoundError` in the except block. The else block is optional and runs if no exceptions were raised in the try block, while the finally block always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is often used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    file = open(\"non_existent_file.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    # Handling specific exception\n",
    "    print(\"Error: The file does not exist.\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handling generic exception\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to run if no exceptions were raised\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)finally:\n",
